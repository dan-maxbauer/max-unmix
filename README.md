Instructional videos are available online in the ‘Resources’ tab of the MAX UnMix webpage.

If you will be processing a large amount of data using MAX UnMix - it is advantageous to run the program locally (offline). To run MAX UnMix locally on your own computer follow the steps below.

##########
1. Download BOTH R and R-studio to your computer. Instructions for downloads can be found at:
	R = https://www.r-project.org/
	R studio = https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

2. Save the MAX UnMix folder to your computer 

3. Open R-studio

4. In “Console” enter the following text and hit return: 
	
	- ```install.packages("shiny")``` # load the shiny package into R
	- ```install.packages("shinyBS")```
	- ```install.packages("fGarch")```
	- ```install.packages("MESS")```
	- ```library("shiny")``` # this need to be entered each time R-studio is re-launched to run program (contains runApp() function below)
	- ```setwd("enter file path to max-unmix folder")``` #tells R where to find app
	- ```runApp("max-unmix")``` #will launch app in browser or local R-studio window
	
The packages will only need to be installed once and subsequently the application can be launched using the library, setwd and runApp commands.
